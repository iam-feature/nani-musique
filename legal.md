USE OF DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND COMPONENT SEALS, LOGOS, OTHER OFFICIAL INSIGNIA, NAMES AND INITIALS
Department of Justice seals, logos and other official insignia may not be used or reproduced without written permission. Requests for permission to use or reproduce the official insignia of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Bureau of Prisons, Federal Prison Industries, Parole Commission, Drug Enforcement Administration, United States Marshals Service and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives shall be referred to the heads of these components. Requests for permission to use or reproduce any other Department or component official insignia shall be referred to the Assistant Attorney General for Administration. Permission to use or reproduce official insignia of the Department is granted on a case-by-case basis and involves the consideration of many relevant factors, including: the cost or benefit to the Department or the government of granting the request; the unintended appearance of endorsement or authentication by the Department; the potential for misuse; the effect on Department security; the reputability of the use; and the extent of control by the Department over the ultimate use and distribution of any product(s) or publication(s) bearing official insignia of the Department.

The use of the names or initials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the United States Marshals Service is governed by 18 U.S.C. sec. 709, which prohibits their unauthorized use in a manner calculated to convey the impression that such use is approved, endorsed, or authorized by that component, unless written permission has been received from the head of the respective component.
